# TempMonitor

A simple temperature monitor that checks the temperature outside:

    $ python tempmonitor.py
    22.4Â°C

The program also stores the latest temperature to a file, allowing
the comparison of the current temperature to the previous temperature.
If the `--boundary` argument is given, and the temperature drops below
the provided boundary, a messagebox will also be shown.
This is useful when the script is tasked to run every X minutes
with cron or Task Scheduler, as it will let you know when
the temperature outside drops below a certain boundary.

All supported command line arguments:

- `place` (positional):
    Where to check the temperature from.
    Default: `helsinki`
- `--boundary [float]`:
    The boundary after which a messagebox will be shown.
    Default: `None`
- `--boundary-file [str]`:
    Path to a file to store the previous temperature into.
    Default: `%APPDATA%\\tempmonitor.txt`
